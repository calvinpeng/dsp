* touch = creating a file using `touch` command
* rm = deleting a file
* mv = renaming a file
* ls -a = listing hidden files
* cp <dir1> <dir2> = copying a file from one directory to another

Make a cheat sheet for yourself: a list of at least **ten** commands and what they do.  (Use the 8 items above and add a couple of your own.)  

> > grep <text> <location> = search for text in location (global regular expression print)  
> > sed 's/<find>/<replace>/g = (g)lobal find and replace. (stream editor)
